Online May 10th, 2018
Deadline: June 3rd, 2018 (11.59pm, Rome time zone)
Tasks to do
The homeworks must be completed alone. Each student should do its own homework. Download the file Homework2.zip from the course homepage in Piazza https://piazza.com/uniroma1.it/spring2018/1044398/home
After unzipping you will find this file, and 2 directories, one (Common) contains the required libraries, and one contains the files to modify (Homework2.html and Homework2.js). These are the files of example figure of Chapter 9 of the examples of the textbook, these are meant only as an example, not a starting point. You need to modify the files deleting all the sliders and completely replacing the figure present in the file with the new one described below. The tasks you need to complete are.
1. Create a hierarchical model of a (simplified) dog, composed of the following parts;
a. body
b. 4 legs, each one composed of 2 independent components (upper and lower leg)
c. head
d. tail
All components are cubes, use the cube function present in the file
2. Add a procedural texture to the body of the dog. The texture should be a checkerboard pattern but with a linear decrease of intensity from the front to the back of the body. Use, as a reference, textureCube4 of Chapter 7 of the examples of the textbook. Notice however that you should not apply a sinusoid but a linear decrease in the direction of the tail.
3. Add a button that starts an animation of the dog so that, starting from an initial position where it is standing and positioned along the x axis, it walks to the right by moving (alternatively back and forth) the legs and turns the head in the direction of the viewer.
Describe your solution in a short document (2-3) describing your solution, the document should include a brief description of the techniques used, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution, the features of your solution. This file should be submitted in PDF format and its name should be student ID number (numero di matricola). If you do not have a Sapienza student ID number, use your last name.
